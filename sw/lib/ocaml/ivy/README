OCaml (caml.org) bindings for the Ivy library (www.tls.cena.fr/products/ivy).

Two libraries are provided:
 - ivy-ocaml, running with the Ivy main loop (module IvyLoop)
 - glibivy-ocaml, running with the Glib main loop (provided by lablgtk)

Installation:
 - Requires the OCaml compiler and the ivy-c library
 - "make" to compile
 - "make install" to set the files (DESTDIR may be specified)
 - "examples" directory contains the ivyprobe program for both main loops
("make ivyivyprobe.out" and "make glibivyprobe.out")

Documentation:
 - The Ivy documentation (www.tls.cena.fr/products/ivy)
 - The .mli files (ivy.mli, ivyLoop.mli and glibIvy.mli)
